- 👋 Hi, I’m @hummingbee57
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, java, web development, and robotics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `pygame`, Geometry, and how to cook.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, python applications, and homework (meaning you do my homework).
- I started coding when I was eight years old, and the first text-based language I learned was Python!
